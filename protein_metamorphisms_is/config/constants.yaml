  - name: "CE-align"
    description: "CE-align, or Combinatorial Extension, is a method for pairwise protein structure alignment. It focuses on aligning backbone atoms by identifying and extending aligned fragment pairs, offering insights into protein function and evolutionary history."
    task_name: combinatorial_extension

  - name: "US-align"
    description: "US-align (Universal Structural alignment) is a unified protocol to compare 3D structures of different macromolecules (proteins, RNAs and DNAs) in different forms (monomers, oligomers and heterocomplexes) for both pairwise and multiple structure alignments. The core alogrithm of US-align is extended from TM-align and generates optimal structural alignments by maximizing TM-score of compared strucures through heuristic dynamic programming iterations. Large-scale benchmark tests showed that US-align can generate more accurate structural alignments with significantly reduced CPU time, compared to the state-of-the-art methods developed for specific structural alignment tasks. TM-score has values in (0,1] with 1 indicating an identical structure match, where a TM-score ≥0.5 (or 0.45) means the structures share the same global topology for proteins (or RNAs)."

  - name: "FATCAT"
    description: "FATCAT (Flexible structure AlignmenT by Chaining Aligned fragment pairs allowing Twists), Protein structures are flexible and undergo structural rearrangements as part of their function. FATCAT (Flexible structure AlignmenT by Chaining Aligned fragment pairs allowing Twists) is an approach for flexible protein structure comparison. It simultaneously addresses the two major goals of flexible structure alignment; optimizing the alignment and minimizing the number of rigid-body movements (twists) around pivot points (hinges) introduced in the reference structure."

structural_complexity_levels:
  - name: "Protein Chains"
    description: A protein chain refers to a single, linear sequence of amino acids that are covalently bonded together through peptide bonds. This chain, also known as a polypeptide, represents the primary structure of a protein. The sequence in which the amino acids are arranged dictates the protein's unique characteristics and functions. After synthesis, the protein chain undergoes folding, where it adopts a specific three-dimensional structure essential for its biological activity. Protein chains can function independently or combine with other chains (which can be identical or different) to form a functional protein complex. The term "protein chains" emphasizes the linear aspect of proteins before they fold into their functional conformations.

  - name: "Secondary Structures"
    description: Secondary structures refer to the local spatial arrangement of the protein's backbone, excluding the side chains of the amino acids. The two most common types of secondary structures are alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Alpha-helices are right-handed coils stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms, while beta-sheets consist of two or more strands aligned next to each other, forming a sheet-like structure also stabilized by hydrogen bonding. These structures are fundamental components of a protein's overall three-dimensional conformation and play critical roles in defining its function. Secondary structures are formed as a result of hydrogen bonds between the amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms in the peptide backbone, and their formation is driven by the protein's primary sequence.
